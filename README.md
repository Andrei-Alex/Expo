## About The Project

This project is an investigative exploration designed to understand and compare the capabilities, unique features, and development experience between Expo and React Native. Through this project, developers can gain insights into the advantages and limitations of each framework, making it easier to choose the right tool for their next mobile application development project.

### Objectives

- To showcase the setup and initialization differences between Expo and React Native.
- To understand how Expo framework handles the development of common app features.
- To compare the build and deployment process for apps developed with each framework.
- To evaluate the developer experience, including debugging, testing, and adding third-party libraries.
